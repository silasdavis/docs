In order to be a Validator on the Agreements Network you will need to perform the following:
Install Go programing language
Obtain Bosmarmot tooling 

How do you obtain Monax-keys 
Get monax-keys:
go get -u github.com/monax/bosmarmot/keys/cmd/monax-keys
Run monax-keys server

On the machine you intend to run as validator (requires the jq tool available on most distributions)

We generate a key passing its address into the convert command to give us the output we need

monax-keys convert --addr $(monax-keys gen --no-pass) | jq '{address: .address, pubKey: .pub_key[1]}' > validator_info.json

Send validator_info.json to  join@agreements.network and keep a note of the validator key you will need to configure your node

How to register your own key with the network for approval into the validator pool

Email public key and address to join@agreements.network

How to boot your burrow node and connect into the network

Download genesis.json from 
info.t1.agreements.network/genesis.json to your local directory

Create a local config file 
Burrow -c base.toml configure

Change the seeds field in the burrow.toml to:
tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/001:80,tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/002:80,tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/003:80,tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/004:80,tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/005:80,tcp://1B1ECA9055642DC89C04ADC477FB08C9D09A9570@peers.t1.agreements.network/006:80

Change the moniker field in the burrow.toml to: 
ORGNAME-t1.agreements.network-validator

Start burrow with the local burrow.toml and local genesis.json
